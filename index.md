## About me

I'm a Research Engineer on Automatic Control. Currently, I'm working on the COVNI Team at [ONERA - The French Aerospace Lab](https://www.onera.fr/fr) - Toulouse Midi-Pyrenées center.

After having graduated as a Mechatronics Engineer by the Federal University of Uberlândia (Uberlândia, Brazil) in 2018, I got my PhD degree in 2021 from the University of Lille. My thesis, carried out at Inria Lille - Nord Europe under supervision of [Denis Efimov](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/~efimov/), was entitled _"Control and estimation methods applied to microbial communities"_.
